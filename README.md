# Reddit Insight Engine üöÄ

An automated Python script that fetches top posts from specific subreddits, summarizes them using an AI, and distributes the insights as an email newsletter and social media posts.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Subreddit Fetching**: Pulls the top posts from a predefined list of subreddits (e.g., r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur).
-   **AI-Powered Summaries**: Leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) like Google's Gemini to generate concise, insightful summaries.
-   **Dual-Format Output**: Creates a short summary for email newsletters and a more detailed version for blog/social media posts.
-   **Automated Distribution**:
    -   Sends formatted emails to a subscriber list via an email service provider.
    -   (Optional) Posts detailed summaries directly to platforms like LinkedIn or Medium.
-   **Scheduled Execution**: Designed to be run automatically on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule using a cron job or other schedulers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script follows a simple, linear flow:

1.  **Fetch**: Connects to the Reddit API to retrieve the top posts from the target subreddits for a given period.
2.  **Summarize**: Sends the collected post titles, content, and top comments to an AI API for summarization.
3.  **Publish**: Uses the generated summaries to format and send content through various publisher APIs (e.g., SendGrid for email, LinkedIn API for posts).
